CodeCrunch Rapid Grader
=====================

Allow NUS CodeCrunch graders to do their job more efficiently. It allows the grader to open grader's code edit page of all students' submission with one click. 

How to use:
1) Login and go to any submission list page
2) Adjust the amount of questions you want to grade using the dropdown under the table view (> 20 will probably cause your browser to hang, dependent on computer)
3) Click on 'Grade all on page' link and confirm the number of windows to open

ToDo: 
- It opens the edit view of only the first file now, will make it open the submission tab for multiple files
- For single file submission, it works on the assumption that all file names submitted will be the same. Will modify to support different filenames
